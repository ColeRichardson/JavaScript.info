there are 8 basic types in javaScript

javascript is a dynamically typed language meaning that the type of a varaible can change.

numbers:
besides regular numbers there are so-called special numeric values which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity, NaN.
1/0 = Infinity

BigInt:
-In JavaScript the number type cannot represent integer values larger than 2^53-1 = 9007188254740991 or less than -(2^53) -1 for negatives. 
-BigInt type was added to represent integers of arbitrary length.
-A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer. 
-right now BigInt is supported by chrome/firefox/edge but not safari/IE.

-const bigInt = 1231345134523452345234523452345234523452345n;

String:
-a string in java msut be surrounded by quotes
-there are 3 types of quotes in java-script:
1) double quotes "Hello"
2) single quotes 'Hello'
3) backticks: `Hello`
-double and single quotes are basically the same, they are called "simple" quotes
-Backticks are "extended functionality" quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expression into a string by wrapping them in ${...}, for example 
let name = John;
//embed a variable
alert(`Hello, ${name}!`); //Hello, John!
//embed an expression
alert(`the result is ${1 + 2}`) //the result is 3
-the expression insde the ${...} is evaluated and the result becomes a part of the string 

-There is no char data type in Javascript, only string.

Boolean(Logical Type):
-the boolean only has two values true and false.
-works obviously and similar to other languages python, java, etc.

The "null" value:
-the special null type does not belong to any of the types described above, its the sole member of its own type. Its not a null pointer like in c, it just represents empty, nothing, or value unknown.

The "undefined" value:
-the special value undefined also stands apart, its makes a type of its own just like null. 
-the meaning of undefined is "value not assigned"
-example, we can also see that we can explicitly assign something as undefined.
let age;
alert(age); // shows undefined
let age = 100;
age = undefined;
alert(age); //  show undefined
-although you should jsut use null in this context.

Objects and Symbols:
-the object type is special.
-all other types are called primitive because they can only contain a single thing. be it a number or a string. 
-in contrasts objects store a collection of data and more complex entities.
-the symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for obejcts

The typeof operator:
-the typeof operator returns the type of the argument. 
-it supports 2 forms of syntax:
1) as an operator typeof x
2) as a function typeof(x)
-either way the result is the same, it jsut returns a string containing the name of the type.
