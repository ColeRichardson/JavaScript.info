to create a variable in JAvaScript use the let keyword
example: 
let message; //declares the variable
message = "Hello"; //stores the word Hello in the variable
alert(message); // shows the message content

can be combined into a single line.
let message = "hello";

also can declare multiple variables in one line:
let user = "john", age ="25",  message = "Hello";

however for the sake of readability we normally want to be using the multi line variation. 

in older scripst you masy find the use of var instead of let. there are subtle differnces that will be covered later in the course.

note that declaring the same variable twice causes an error. 

variable naming: ther are 2 main naming convention in java script 
1) the name must contain only letters, digits or the symbols $ and _
2) the first character must not be a digit

case matters apple and Apple are two differnt variables.

dont need to declare with let in use strict mode, will cause an error if we try to asssign to a varaible that hasnt been declared when use strict mode has been enabled. 

to delcare a constant use const instead of let when declaring the variable. const and let are the same except const variables cannot be reassgined to different values once given an inital value.
are declared with an inital value. 

will cause an error if you try to reassign a different value to the variable.
