statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions, alert("Hello World!") is a statement.
We can seperate statements with semicolons like so alert("Hello"); alert("World!"); 
but are usually also written on seperate lines to make the code more human readable.
a semi colon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists:
alert("Hello")
alert("World!")
also works, this is called an automatic semicolon insertion.

if the expression is incomplete, and a new line is added, JavaScript wont insert a semicolon.
also, when the expression after the newline starts with square brackets [], JavaScript will again, not insert a semicolon.

sure it's possible to omit semicolons sometimes, but its safer to just use them to seperate statements all the time. 

COMMENTS:
single line comments start with a // for example
// this is a single line comment

Multi-line comments start with a /* and end with a */
/* this
is
a 
multi
line
comment
*/

similar to java.

NESTED comments are not supported.
