to use the modern mode of JavaScript, we need to enable the modifications made to ECMAScript 5 in 2009 by using a directive "use strict"
or 'use_strict'
this directive must be included at the very top of the script before any other code is executed.
strict mode cannot be canceled once it has been enabled within a script. so if part of the script requires strict mode, 
then the whole script muist be written to comply with the specifications of strict mode in ecma5. 
in the developer console we just use shift+enter to enter multiple lines
dont forget to insert the semicolon after the 'use strict'; directive like so.

Modern javaScript supports clsses and modules advanced language structures that enable use strict automatically.
so for now 'use strict' at the top of the script along with <!DOCTYPE HTML> and <html> </html>

all examples in this tutorial envolve strict mode, unless stated otherwise (rarely)
