The script tag can be used in html documents to insert Javascript programs
into html files like so: <script> alert ("Hello World!"); </script>
see HelloWorldJS.html for an example.

If we have a lot of complex JavaScript code we can also write the JavaScript code in its own file like helloWorld.js for example, and then insert that entire file as a script with the src attribute like so:
<script src="helloWorld.js"></script> 
see externalJS.html and helloWorld.js for an example.
the path can be either absolute or relative. in the above example we are assuming that helloWorld.js lies in the same folder as our html file.

we can also give a full url as the script src attribute. like so:
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>

to attach several scripts, just use multiple tags.

if src is set, the script content is ignored, this wont work:
<script src="file.js">
alert(1);
</script>

a script tag also has type and language attributes, but in modern use cases these attributes are rarely used.
As a result htey are not required.

Also, a cool trick I learnt on my own, you can use linux terminal to open webpages with either firefox or chrome
by using the command firefox <filename>.html or google-chrome <filename>.html respectively.
